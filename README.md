## 📌 Project Overview

**Into the Ruins: Last Breath** is a 3D survival-action game developed using **PyOpenGL** as part of the CSE 423 Computer Graphics Lab (Lab Assignment 3 constraints).

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world destroyed by a nuclear explosion. The player must survive toxic air, defeat mutant creatures, and collect all survival kits before the environment becomes uninhabitable.

## 🎮 Game Objective

* Collect **all 6 Survival Kits**
* Avoid mutants and environmental hazards
* Manage rising **Air Pollution (Oxygen depletion system)**
* Reach the **Escape Bunker** to win

⚠️ If pollution reaches 100%, hearts drop to 0, or survival fails → GAME OVER

---

## 🗺️ Game World

* World Size: **1200 x 650 units**
* Divided into:

  * **Exploration Zone (Left 2/3)** → ruins, enemies, hidden kits
  * **Safe Zone (Right 1/3)** → Escape bunker
* Environment includes:

  * Ruined buildings
  * Breakable glowing walls
  * Rope/wire barriers
  * Rocks & debris
  * Toxic fog system

## ⚙️ Core Mechanics

### ☠️ Survival System

* Air Pollution increases over time
* Reaching 100% → GAME OVER
* Collecting survival kits reduces pollution

### 🔫 Combat System

* Gun (shoot mutants)
* Hammer (break walls)
* Knife (cut ropes)
* Bullet-based enemy elimination

### 👾 Enemy System

* Mutant AI pursues player
* Collision reduces hearts
* Drops ammo/hearts (40% chance)

### 🧱 Interaction System

* Breakable walls (3-hit system)
* Rope barriers
* Hidden collectibles
